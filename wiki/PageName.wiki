#Boost Graph Library clone

= Our mimic of Boost Graph library called CS::Graph =

We are going to reverse engineer part of the boost graph library for a school project


= Implementation =

We are going to mimic a representation of a directed graph using adjacency list. We are using an std::vector of std::set to represent our graph.
